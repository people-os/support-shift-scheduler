**Support agent onboarding next week**

Each new onboarding agent has been paired with a senior support agent for each of their shifts. The senior agent will act as a mentor for the onboarding agents, showing them the ropes during these onboarding shifts (see the [onboarding document](https://github.com/balena-io/process/blob/master/process/support/onboarding_agents_to_support.md) for background). Here are the mentor-novice pairings for next week:
