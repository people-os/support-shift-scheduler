# Balena support shift scheduler

At balena, we practise support-driven development - you can read more about this philosophy in our [Support Driven Development blog post](https://www.balena.io/blog/support-driven-development/) from a few years ago. This means that we don’t outsource our customer support; it’s handled by our own engineers, who work from a wide variety of time zones, and across flexible working hours.  We offer customer support 16 hours every weekday, from 8 am to midnight London time (UTC+1 during daylight saving time, UTC otherwise), every week of the year.

This scheduling project enables us to schedule our engineers to cover our support hours, considering multiple factors, for example avoiding scheduling agents outside of their preferred hours. Hence the goal of the support scheduler: maximising support scheduling fairness and efficiency, while minimising pain. You can find a detailed discussion of the considerations relevant to the scheduler in our blog post titled [The unreasonable effectiveness of algorithms in boosting team happiness](https://www.balena.io/blog/the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-algorithms-in-boosting-team-happiness/). You will notice that some of the soft constraint coefficients as defined at the top of the [./algo-core/ortools_solver.py](./algo-core/ortools_solver.py) script have since been adapted somewhat from the values given in the blog post, but the underlying principles are still the same.

The current version of the solver also includes the following functionality that was not recorded in the blog post:

* **Night shifts:** the number of agents we have whose working hours cover the 19:00 - 24:00 UK time period, tend to be lower than the number covering the rest of the support hours. We therefore have the option for agents in European and similar time zones to volunteer for doing support 19:00 - 24:00 on specific nights. These "night shift" hours are encoded with the number "4" in the hourly preference input per agent, and are handled by the scheduler as hard-coded shifts, with the rest of the support hours filled dynamically around these.
* **Onboarding of new agents:** Once newly hired engineers have been with balena for a few months, they are onboarded to support. This involves scheduling them for two 4-hour onboarding shifts per week for 2 weeks, during which they are mentored by one of a selected group of senior support agents. These onboarding shifts are additional to the default number of parallel tracks, and require their own set of solver constraints. See the "Usage" section below for more detail on how to configure this.
* **Extra parallel track on Monday morning:** Even though we have support agents on call over the weekends, they are only expected to solve the most urgent issues for our customers, while non-urgent support queries wait until Monday. The result is that the support inbox on a Monday morning is fuller than on other days, therefore an extra agent is scheduled from 08:00 - 12:00 UK time to help address the queries that have accumulated over the weekend.

The core of the algorithm is a constraint solver, and we currently use the [Google OR-tools CP-SAT solver](https://developers.google.com/optimization/cp/cp_solver), which is well suited to [scheduling optimisation](<https://developers.google.com/optimization/scheduling/job_shop>).



## Requirements

For local development, you need to `Clone or download` the repository to your local machine. You will need working installations of:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (>=3.7.5) for the core scheduling algorithm, 
- [Python Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for installing the Python modules.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (>= 11.12.0, including npm) for the helper scripts.

Then, you need to install the prerequisite modules by executing the following on your command line, from within the project's root directory:

```bash
# Install node modules, creating a node_modules folder:
$ npm install
# Install Python modules:
$ poetry install     
```

### For balena team members

You will also need:

- A JSON file with credentials associated with the existing service account of our `Support Algo Calendar` Google Cloud project.
- To create a `.env` file in the project root directory (which you can base on the included [.env.dist](.env.dist)), defining the following environment variables:
  - `TEAM_MODEL_ID `: Google Spreadsheet ID of the `Team Model` sheet.
  - `SUPPORT_SCHEDULER_HISTORY_ID`: Google Spreadsheet ID of the `Support Scheduler History` sheet.
  - `GAPI_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JWT`: The path to the JSON credentials.
  - `CALENDAR_ID`: Google Calendar ID of the `Support schedule` calendar.
  - `SUPPORT_RESOURCES`: link to support process documentation.

For assistance, please contact `@AlidaOdendaal`, or operations.



### For the public

**The explanation in this section is just for clarity; if you just want to test the scheduling algorithm, you can skip to the *Usage* section below.**

This project makes use of a [Google Service Account](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/service-accounts) to authenticate with the Google Sheets API to download input data, and with the Google Calendar API to create calendar events. *If* you'd like to set up a similar Google Cloud Project, you have to create a `.env` file in the project root directory, defining the following environment variables:

- `GAPI_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JWT`: The path to the JSON credentials associated with your service account.
- `CALENDAR_ID`: Google Calendar ID of the calendar you would like the events to be written to.

You would also need to modify [`./lib/gsheets.js`](./lib/gsheets.js) and [`./helper-scripts/download-and-configure-input.js`](./helper-scripts/download-and-configure-input.js) to make sure that the correct data is being downloaded from your Google Sheets, and configured correctly for the scheduler.



## Usage

### 1. Configure Google Sheet input

#### For balena team members

In the `Team Model` Google Sheet:

1. Check that the `Next Cycle Dates` tab reflects the correct Monday date (in YYYY-MM-DD format) for the week for which you need to create the support schedule.

2. If there will be new team members onboarding to support in the week to be scheduled, ensure that you have onboarded them all in the `Team Model`.

3. From the `Custom scripts` menu, run `Refresh UK Time Support Availabilities`, and wait for the script to finish.

4. From the `Custom scripts` menu, run `Update Support Scheduler Input`, and wait for the script to finish.

   

### 2. Downloading and configuring the algorithm input

#### For balena team members

From the project root directory, run:

```bash
$ node ./helper-scripts/download-and-configure-input.js
```

This script will determine the start date of the next support cycle, and download the availability of each support agent for this cycle (compiled from working hours, time zones, time-off data, existing calendar appointments and possible opt-outs, and including e-mail addresses, historical support load and shift length preferences). It will create a JSON input object for the scheduling algorithm. This JSON object is validated against the [json input schema](./lib/schemas/support-shift-scheduler-input.schema.json), and then stored in the file `./logs/<start-date>/support-shift-scheduler-input.json` .

#### For the public

Since you do not have access to our private Google Spreadsheets, an example JSON input file has already been created for you, to enable you to do a test run of the algorithm. It is located under [`./logs/example/support-shift-scheduler-input.json`](./logs/example/support-shift-scheduler-input.json).

#### Then, for everyone

The JSON input object thus created has two main properties:

- `agents`, containing the data for all the support agents, and
- `options`, containing a number of options that are fed into the scheduler. This includes the optimisation timeout for the solver, with a default value of 1 hour set by the `download-and-configure-input.js` script. However, the timeout is set to 1 minute in the example input, for the sake of easy testing. If necessary, these should be modified before running the core algorithm.

For more detail regarding these `options`, as well as the rest of the input file structure, see the associated [json input schema](./lib/schemas/support-shift-scheduler-input.schema.json).



### 3. Creating input files for onboarding

If there will be new team members onboarding to support in the week to be scheduled, you have to create the following 2 text files in the `./logs/<start-date>/` folder:

1. `onboarding_agents.txt`: A list of Github handles for the onboarding agents.
2. `mentors.txt`: A list of Github handles for the onboarding mentors.

In each of the files above, each handle should start with `@`, and each handle should be on a new line.



### 4. Creating file with recently onboarded agents

If desired, a file named `new_agents.txt` can also be created in the  `./logs/<start-date>/` folder, containing the Github handles of agents that have completed their onboarding very recently (each handle should start with `@`, and each handle should be on a new line.). The algorithm will ensure that these agents are not scheduled simultaneously, i.e. they will always have a more experienced agent as their support buddy on the parallel track.



### 5. Running the scheduling algorithm

While in the project's root directory on your local machine, run the following on the command line to activate the virtual Python environment:

```bash
$ poetry shell
```

From within the relevant `./logs/<start-date>`  directory (or `./logs/example` if you are using the example data), launch the solver with:

```bash
$ python3 ../../algo-core/ortools_solver.py --input support-shift-scheduler-input.json
```

Upon completion, the algorithm will write the optimised schedule to the file `support-shift-scheduler-output.json` (after validating against the [json output schema](./lib/schemas/support-shift-scheduler-output.schema.json)), and also display a summary in the terminal.

If the `Solution type` is `OPTIMAL`, it means that the solver has determined this to be the solution with the lowest possible cost ("pain") value given the defined parameter space. If the `Solution type` is `FEASIBLE`, it means that this solution is the best one the solver could find given the set optimisation timeout.



### 6. Beautifying the schedule

From within the `./logs/<start-date>`  directory (or `./logs/example` if you are using the example data), run:

```bash
$ node ../../helper-scripts/beautify-schedule.js support-shift-scheduler-output.json
```

This script writes a formatted schedule to the file `beautified-schedule.txt`, which is a helpful view as a sanity check that the schedule is legitimate. The script also writes message text for our internal chat to the file `flowdock-message.txt`, which is used to ping the support agents to go check their calendars after the Google Calendar invites have been sent.

If, for some reason, the schedule needs to be modified, it should be edited directly in `support-shift-scheduler-output.json`, after which the `beautify-schedule.js` script should be rerun as above to update the text files.



### 7. Sending the calendar invites

#### For balena team members

From the project root directory, run:

```bash
$ node ./helper-scripts/send-calendar-invites.js logs/<start-date>/support-shift-scheduler-output.json
```

to write the finalised schedule to the `Support schedule` Google Calendar, sending invites to all the associated agents.



### 8. Notify the team in Flowdock

#### For balena team members

* Paste the content of `flowdock-message.txt` to the support room in Flowdock.
* If the support week involves the onboarding of new agents, paste the content of `onboarding_message.txt` to the support room in Flowdock as well.
